## First Node Server Code

This code snippet demonstrates a basic Node.js server setup that responds with "Hello World!" for every request.

## Request-Response Model

This code snippet implements a Node.js server that responds differently based on the requested URL. It provides different responses for the home page ("/"), about page ("/about"), and contact page ("/contact").

## URL Module

The code snippet showcases the usage of the URL module in Node.js to parse and extract information from a URL. It demonstrates extracting the hostname, pathname, and search parameters from a sample URL.

## File Read Asynchronous

This code snippet illustrates reading a file asynchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It reads the contents of the "Home.html" file and sends it as the response when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Read Synchronous

This code snippet demonstrates reading a file synchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It reads the contents of the "Home.html" file synchronously and sends it as the response when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Rename Asynchronous

The code snippet showcases renaming a file asynchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It renames the file "demo.txt" to "demoNew.txt" and sends a success or failure message accordingly when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Rename Synchronous

This code snippet demonstrates renaming a file synchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It renames the file "demo.txt" to "demoNew.txt" and sends a success or failure message accordingly when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Delete Asynchronous

The code snippet illustrates deleting a file asynchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It deletes the file "demoNew.txt" and sends a success or failure message accordingly when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Delete Synchronous

This code snippet showcases deleting a file synchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It deletes the file "demo.txt" and sends a success or failure message accordingly when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Exist Sync

The code snippet demonstrates checking the existence of a file synchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It checks if the file "demo1.txt" exists and sends a corresponding message when accessing the root URL ("/").

## File Exist Async

This code snippet showcases checking the existence of a file asynchronously using the `fs` module in Node.js. It checks if the file "demo.txt" exists and sends a corresponding message when accessing the root URL ("/").
